# Kanban by Mark Hagelberg

Task tracking, built in React/Tailwind/TypeScript. Bootstrapped with [Vite](https://main.vitejs.dev/guide/).


## Startup Instructions

Start the dev server with:

```
yarn
yarn vite
```

The app stores board state in localStorage under the key `kanban.state.v1` so your cards persist across reloads.
