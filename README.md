# Kanban by Mark Hagelberg

Task tracking, built in React/Tailwind/TypeScript. Bootstrapped with [Vite](https://main.vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Time Spent and shortcuts

I spent about 5-6 hours on this.
It was built with Github Copilot in VSCode. This sped up development quite a bit. I decided to go for all of the stretch goals,but I kept the styling minimal.

## Startup Instructions

Start the dev server with:

```
yarn
yarn vite
```

The app stores board state in localStorage under the key `kanban.state.v1` so your cards persist across reloads.
